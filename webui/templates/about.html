            <h3><a id="whatis"></a>What is 3DHub.io</h3>

            <p>A collaboration platform for people to share and improve on 3D models, with a workflow similar to GitHub,
                Gitlab, and Gitea.</p>

            <h3><a id="why"></a>Why?</h3>

            <p>
                Justin Clift, the primary author for 3DHub.io (so far) has been doing 3D modelling for several years
                using both Open Source and commercial software.  In that time, although various public websites have
                appeared which allow for model sharing (eg GrabCAD), none of them allow for good collaboration on models
                by multiple authors.
            </p>

            <p>
                3DHub.io aims to change that, by providing a good platform where people can upload, download, modify,
                and contribute back changes to 3D models and assemblies.  The entire code base is Open Source, so anyone
                wanting to run their own instance of it (eg locally), or extend and improve upon is is able to do so.
            </p>

            <p>If we can generate sufficient ongoing revenue to make this all work, then yay, everyone wins! :)</p>

            <h3><a id="howopen"></a>How much is Open Source?</h3>

            <p>
                <i><b>Everything</b></i> is open source (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL3</a>
                or later).
            </p>

            <p>
                Nothing held back, no "open core", etc.  This is real, actual, proper, Open Source.  Not the fake
                variety. :)
            </p>

            <h2><a id="pricing"></a>How much will it cost?</h2>

            <p>Completely undetermined at this stage. ;)</p>

            <p>The concept GitHub uses for pricing - free for public stuff, $ for private - is
                appealing, but <b><i>may</i></b> not work for 3D models.  At least initially everything
                will be free, which should give us a start towards understanding usage patterns.</p>

            <p>With that we can develop a workable model, though it may take a few iterations.</p>
