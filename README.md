## DBHub.io

### What it is

An early stage (in development) "Cloud" for SQLite databases, with special
integration for [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org).

You can try out our development server at [https://dev1.dbhub.io](https://dev1.dbhub.io),
or run it locally for your own users.

**Note** - Don't store important data on the dev1 server.  It gets wiped now and again,
when we're experimenting with things.

When the core code is more fully featured (June/July 2017 target), we'll start putting
"production" servers online for people to store their data.
