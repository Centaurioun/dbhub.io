## DBHub.io

### What it is

An early stage (in development) "Cloud" for SQLite databases, with special
integration for [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org).

You can try out our beta testing server at [https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io](https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite),
or run it locally for your own users.

**Note** - Don't store important data on the beta server.  It gets wiped now and again,
when we're experimenting with things.

When the core code is more fully featured (August 2017 target), we'll start putting
"production" servers online for people to store their data.
